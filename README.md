# Work in progress!

# Milestone Project 3 with *Code Institute*

*Shelter* allows users to browse and report the newest and most necessary outdoor gear on the market.

Being outside and living an active life is a lot of fun. And even if you don't need a lot to be enjoying the outside I am impressed by all the innovative little (and big) gear innovations on the market. I always try to find useful gadgets and tools to make the best of camping trips and hiking adventures. 

This site is the third of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Course at *Code Institute*. The core reuqirements focus on bulding a fullstack site with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Phython (incl. Flask) and MangoDB. The final result is hosted on Heroku.

## UX

- idea is to build a community based outdoor gear & gadgets collection
- content is generated by community and site owner
- author are in control of their postings
- admin can choose specific postings to be in the featured feed

## User Stories

- As a user I can browse gear postings, so that I can find the latest trends and innovation from the outdoor industry.
- As a user I can sign up, so I can add postings to the site.
- As a user I can log in, so that I can add postings with my account.
- As a user I can manage my own postings, so that I have full control over my posts.
- As a user I can log out from the site, so that I can access the site even on public devices (e.g. library).
- As a user I can delete my account, so that I am in total control of my account data. (AC: account is deleted from users db, postings remain in gear db)
- As a user I can access details from a posting, so that I can see the whole set of information.
- As a user I can search the site, so that I quickly find equipment or special postings.
- As a user I can see the latest 6 postings on the landing page, so that i quickly notice new gear recommendations.

#### Step-by-Step

Official Github Documentation on cloning a repositiory: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

1. Navigate to Mainpage of the repository
2. Click on "Code" button
3. Choose "Clone with HTTPs" & copy URL
4. Open Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to prefered location
6. Type git clone and past copied URL ``` git clone https://github.com/p0wen/shelter.git ```
7. Press Enter to create local Clone
 `- Make sure your environment supports python3 -`
8. Type ``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ``` into Terminal
9. Create env.py, .env and .gitignore and add the first 2 to git ignore 
10. Fill env.py with the following data:
``` 
from environs import Env

env = Env()
env.read_env()

# Override in .env for local development
DEBUG = env.bool("FLASK_DEBUG", default=False)
SECRET_KEY = env.str("SECRET_KEY")
# MONGO Connection
MONGO_DBNAME = env.str("MONGO_DBNAME")
MONGO_URI = env.str("MONGO_URI")
```
11. Fill .env with the following data:
```
DEBUG=true
MONGO_DBNAME="<INSERT NAME OF YOUR COLLETION>"
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<INSERT USERNAME>:<INSERT PASSWORD>@<INSERT CLUSTERNAME>.zbpbq.mongodb.net/<INSERT COLLECTION NAME>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
SECRET_KEY="<INSERT SECRET_KEY>"
```
12. Run the application locally by entering  ```python3 app.py``` into your terminal


### Deployment to Heroku

1. Log in to your Heroku account and create a new App.
2. Set the environment variables in Settings > Reveal Config Variables
3. The following Variables must be set
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://<INSERT USERNAME>:<INSERT PASSWORD>@<INSERT CLUSTERNAME>.zbpbq.mongodb.net/<INSERT COLLECTION NAME>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGO_DBNAME = <INSERT YOUR COLLECTION NAME>
SECRET_KEY = <INSERT YOUR SECRET KEY>
IP = 0.0.0.0
PORT = 5000
4. Create requirements.txt from your project with the help of ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt ```
5. Create a Procfile ```echo web: python app.py > Procfile``` 
6. Commit changes to Git ```git add . ``` followed by ```git commit -m ""```
7. Log in to heroku from your terminal ```heroku login```
8. Add exisitng repository to Heroku ```heroku git:remote -a <your repository>```
9. Push changes to Heroku ```git push heroku master```
10. Visit the app url from heroku and check out your great site!
