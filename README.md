# Milestone Project 3 with *Code Isntitute*

*Shelter* allows users to browse and report the newest and most necessary outdoor gear on the market.

Being outside and living an active life is a lot of fun. And even if you don't need a lot to be enjoying the outside i am impressed by all the innovative little (and big) gear innovations on the market. I always try to find useful gadgets and tools to make the best of camping trips and hiking adventures. 

This site is the third of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Course at *Code Institute*. The core reuqirements focus on bulding a fullstack site with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Phython (incl. Flask) and MangoDB. The final result is hosted on Heroku.
