# Work in progress!

# Milestone Project 3 with *Code Institute*

*Shelter* allows users to browse and report the newest and most necessary outdoor gear on the market.

Being outside and living an active life is a lot of fun. And even if you don't need a lot to be enjoying the outside I am impressed by all the innovative little (and big) gear innovations on the market. I always try to find useful gadgets and tools to make the best of camping trips and hiking adventures. 

This site is the third of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Course at *Code Institute*. The core reuqirements focus on bulding a fullstack site with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Phython (incl. Flask) and MangoDB. The final result is hosted on Heroku.

## UX

- idea is to build a community based outdoor gear & gadgets collection
- content is generated by community and site owner
- author are in control of their postings
- admin can choose specific postings to be in the featured feed

## User Stories

- As a user I can browse gear postings, so that I can find the latest trends and innovation from the outdoor industry.
- As a user I can sign up, so I can add postings to the site.
- As a user I can log in, so that I can add postings with my account.
- As a user I can manage my own postings, so that I have full control over my posts.
- As a user I can log out from the site, so that I can access the site even on public devices (e.g. library).
- As a user I can delete my account, so that I am in total control of my account data. (AC: account is deleted from users db, postings remain in gear db)
- As a user I can access details from a posting, so that I can see the whole set of information.
- As a user I can search the site, so that I quickly find equipment or special postings.
- As a user I can see the latest 6 postings on the landing page, so that i quickly notice new gear recommendations.

env.read_env()

# Override in .env for local development
DEBUG = env.bool("FLASK_DEBUG", default=False)
SECRET_KEY = env.str("SECRET_KEY")

MONGO_URI = env.str("MONGO_URI")
```
11. Fill .env with the following data:
```
DEBUG=true
MONGO_DBNAME="<INSERT NAME OF YOUR COLLETION>"
